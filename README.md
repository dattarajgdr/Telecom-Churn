# Business Objective:
The business objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months. 

# Business Problem:
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

 
For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.

 
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
 
# Modelling
Build models to predict churn. The predictive model that youâ€™re going to build will serve two purposes:

- It will be used to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.

- It will be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.
